                                The hype for science stream in India needs no introduction. Each year, more than
                                20 lakh students apply to give entrance exams, of which the most notable ones
                                are JEE and NEET,among dozens of other exams. For those who aren't sure what JEE
                                and NEET are, they are India's most popular entrance examinations; JEE for those
                                who want to be engineers, and NEET for those who want to have a career in
                                medicine or dentistry. Every year, out of 20 lakh aspirants, only a few
                                thousands qualify. In other words, the selection rate is as low as around
                                0.001%. This obviously means that the competition is bound to increase, and thus
                                everyone who is aspiring, starts running in a race to qualify the entrance
                                examinations. The students who qualify for JEE or NEET examinations are eligible
                                to get a seat in India's finest colleges, which are one of the best in terms of
                                both face value and education (In reality, people tend to care more about face
                                value).<br>
                                Naturally, every student in the country aspires to be in one of these colleges,
                                and the selection process means that only a few of them will qualify. This
                                creates a fierce and cut-throat competition, where people are competing for more
                                marks, and hence better ranks. It is evident that you deeply care about your
                                best future, and we assure you are at the right place to get the best guidance
                                from our experienced team (!). We will start our journey by making an analogy:
                                Consider you have to win a race against everyone, by any means. What is the best
                                strategy to win?<br>




                                HOW TO WIN A RACE (AND SUCCEED)<br>

                                Logically, there are only two ways to win a race. Either you run faster than
                                everyone and cross the finish line, or you start running before anyone else
                                does. The second way, which is although funny and sounds like cheating, is what
                                we want to meditate upon and will be the scope of this article.<br>
                                Most of you reading this article are probably in 9th grade or lower. And you
                                wonder how and where to start this "race". If you ask this question to anyone,
                                the first response you will hear would be that it's too early to care about
                                these things. That one must not waste their childhood on such a cause. While
                                there is some truth to that statement, it doesn't answer the question. People
                                don't consider that there are students who are really passionate about learning
                                and those who enjoy studying (these people are often bullied at school as
                                "nerds”). But what really matters is WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. And even if you are
                                not a "nerd", you still probably should start learning earlier. Remember the
                                expression, early bird catches the worm. It is especially true in our context.
                                If you’re completely sure this is the route you want to choose (and I mean 100%
                                sure and quite literally 100%), then go for it. As the others would say, it
                                probably isn’t time for you to start full on preparation and running in the race
                                yet. But the benefit of starting a race early is that one can run at its own
                                pace, however slow or fast they want.<br>
                            </p>

                                <img src="../assets/career/c1.2.jpg" class="img" alt="crisis">

                            <p>
                                Go slow but go steady<br>


                                Without any solid foundations, you will inevitably fail to progress. The biggest
                                benefit of starting early is that you have lots of time to work on strengthening
                                your basics. Don't make a mistake like this stickman (in the figure above), his
                                foundations are not strong at all, and he will eventually fall.<br>
                                Your mental preparation starts now. Start developing skills for complex and hard
                                problems, develop speed and accuracy, get a syllabus and look at it carefully.
                                Start giving Physics-Chemistry-Maths(PCM) or Physics-Chemistry-Biology (PCB)
                                importance, and put other things at less priority which are not of much
                                relevance. You need to make a good foundation. You may have to join a good
                                coaching institute. Read more on this here. (Suggested article: Offline vs
                                online coaching)<br>
                                Start with 9th grade NCERT. It is easy, and it is essential to form the basis.
                                Subjects like Physics and Chemistry can be completed early, so start solving
                                practice problems on them. For Maths, NCERT might not be enough, so you may
                                refer to better reference books. And clear all your basics of PCM (or PCB but
                                still we recommend you to have a strong grip on maths) by now. Start with basics
                                and solve harder problems, and slowly you’ll increase your speed along with
                                accuracy. Don't look at solutions, first try yourself. If unable to solve it,
                                then look for hints, instead of looking at the solutions, rather try to solve on
                                your own. That develops your mind for the competition. At this stage, you will
                                realize the importance of having a good foundation.<br>
                                If you are just starting 9th standard, then try to complete subjects like Hindi,
                                English, Computer, and Social Science during vacations as they are important for
                                school exams. Subjects like these are not essential in the long term. The 9th
                                syllabus isn't too big in itself. If you do these you can solve NCERT without
                                needing anyone's help. NCERT is meant for building your fundamentals. With this,
                                your foundations for school exams are strong. You can be confident in the school
                                examinations. Covering up these during your summer vacations or before the first
                                term of the school is essential. You will get plenty of time for revising and
                                practicing difficult questions.<br>
                                If you rigorously study this way, you may be able to complete everything before
                                6 months. But you don't have to celebrate yet. The race is still far from over.
                                Try to start studying 10th standard science and maths syllabus in your 9th
                                itself. You will have to speed up. Never think you will do these later in
                                future. Competition is very fierce, so you must be starting early with the
                                syllabus. Completing other subjects as mentioned above is essential to avoid
                                conflict when you start studying 10th subjects. Even though studying 10th
                                subjects is optional, you must not procrastinate with it. If you manage to
                                finish even half of the 10th syllabus, you will be on a great start when you
                                reach 10th standard. And trust me, it is a huge confidence booster.<br>
                                Conclusion <br>


                                Start with building your foundations. Have your doubts solved as early as
                                possible. Make sure your basics are cleared. With a weak foundation, you can
                                only go upto a limit, after which you start feeling that the syllabus is
                                getting very tough. And having a good foundation is essential for studying
                                advanced topics. But that's a topic for another article.<br>
