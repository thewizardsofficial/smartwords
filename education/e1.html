                                board has its separate curriculum, education techniques and facilities.<br>

                                So, Parents often wonder where to put their child in CBSE or in the State Board or some
                                other option. Also, many times students also have many type of questions and confusions
                                in their mind regarding this. So, to bust all the myths and to remove all the confusions
                                we bring you this precise and accurate analysis.<br>



                                <b>CBSE VS STATE BOARD<br>


                                :::::{INTRODUCTION}::::::<br> </b>

                                CBSE (established in 1962)<br>

                                The central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) is the National level board with a huge
                                network. It is managed by the union government of India. CBSE is found in 25 countries,
                                with more than 20,000+ schools following it.<br>

                                CBSE follows NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) books.<br>


                                STATE BOARDS:<br>

                                As India has 52 state boards in the country. The network of the state boards is limited
                                to the respective state only (in most cases). The state board is under control of the
                                Ministry of Education of that state or union territory. Generally, in a particular state
                                the number of students studying in State Board is far more than number of CBSE Students
                                in that State.<br>

                                Most of the State Boards have their own curriculum and textbooks. But now-a-days many
                                State Boards follow NCERT books for some subjects.<br>
                                For example: State board of Gujarat, UP board, board of Himachal State, Tripura etc.<br>


                                :::::{Analysis}:::::<br>
                                Let's have a comparison!!<br>

                                1. Course or streams offered:<br>

                                CBSE:<br>

                                In CBSE you get a chance to learn 1 foreign language.
                                Generally, CBSE does not teach Regional Language.
                                In 11th commerce, the option of Commerce with Mathematics is also given in which
                                mathematics which can be applied in commerce is taught.
                                The courses are much more flexible than State Boards.<br>


                                STATE BOARDS<br>

                                The state board does not have the option of commerce with maths.
                                State Boards generally do not have the option of a foreign language.
                                Generally in state boards, you have to learn 3 languages: English, Hindi and the local
                                language of the state.<br> </p>

                                So after analyzing this data and taking views of some students we came to a conclusion
                                that some state boards are tougher to scorer marks, but in most cases CBSE is easier for
                                scoring marks.<br>

                                CBSE<br>

                                1). CBSE gives a child the exposure to many type of National competitions, programs and
                                events.<br>
                                2). CBSE curriculum also teaches about Global History and Economics which is generally
                                not taught in State Boards.<br>
                                3). But, a child who studies in CBSE is less likely to understand the regional culture
                                fully and also less likely to make more local friends. Although this may seem
                                insignificant but many a times the child feels lonely and feels that his/her childhood
                                did not have that spark.<br>
                                4). Also, the child may not learn the regional language very well.<br>


                                STATE BOARDS<br>

                                1. The curriculum is constructed to teach students about their state’s economy,
                                geography, culture, history etc.<br>
                                2. Generally students of state board get opportunity to participate in all state level
                                competitions, programs and events.<br>
                                3. More attention is given to their regional language so that students can learn things
                                in their mother tongue.<br>
                                4. History is more based on their state culture and other regional events.<br>
                                5. Student becomes more familiar to the regional culture, language and gets more
                                opportunity to make local friends as number of students in state boards is generally
                                more.<br></p>

                                Benefits of CBSE<br>

                                1. Focused design and practical approach of the curriculum.<br>

                                2. NCERT books help CBSE’s students to score more marks in exams like UPSC, NEET, JEE,
                                KVPY etc.<br>

                                3. They update their textbooks in every 2-3 years.<br>

                                4. In CBSE there are a lot of learning materials, video lectures and books available for
                                students.<br>
                                5. This board is good for parents who have to migrate from one state to another. So that
                                their child does not suffer from the different-different syllabus.<br>


                                Disadvantages:<br>

                                1. Sometimes the CBSE board becomes 'rot learning'.<br>
                                2. The curriculum is not focused on state, regional and local culture. So, a child can
                                sometimes remain ignorant about our proud Culture and Heritage.<br>
                                3. Sometimes being in CBSE makes a student just a studying machine due to societal
                                pressure and the student may not be able to unleash his/her potential. Even many times
                                students could not pursue their hobby and feels lonely.<br>
                                4. He could miss out the “School-Life Moments” which are an integral part of anyone’s
                                life.<br>
                                5. This board is more expensive than State boards.<br>




                                Benefits of State Boards<br>

                                1. This is a good board for students who want to know about the state's resources and
                                those who want to serve the state.<br>

                                2. The State Board is ideal for parents who do not plan to go from their state to
                                another state.<br>

                                3. The State Board syllabus will help you very much in their state-level competitive
                                examinations.<br>

                                compared to CBSE.<br>



                                Disadvantages:<br>

                                1. The curriculum is not centralized, making it difficult for those parents who have to
                                change the state due to their jobs.<br>

                                2. Sometimes there is just "Rote Learning" in some subjects.<br>

                                3. The course is not made keeping in mind the competitive exams.<br>

                                4. The syllabus is not frequently updated.<br>

                                5. As syllabus is more focused on State Culture a child may not get the exposure to
                                National And International Studies.<br>


                                What should you choose?<br>

                                That’s a good question but the answer depends on various factors like – Nature of
                                Parents’ Job, Earnings, Child’s future goals, in which City and which area you are
                                residing, and also various little things.
                                If parents are having frequently transferring job then they should surely go for CBSE as
                                it is the best option in this case. If a student is surely aiming to study in some
                                famous college of the state only then the preferred choice is State Board. So, one needs
                                to think about many aspects before making any decision and then only come to a logical
                                conclusion.<br>


                                Our results on this battle!!<br>

                                From our analysis and study we come to a conclusion that State Board is Necessary for a
                                Child’s Holistic and Cultural Development whereas CBSE is necessary for a child’s
                                Academic and Professional Development.<br>

                                We would suggest that during initial years at school (i.e upto 8th standard) the student
                                should be kept in State Boards so that in childhood the student learns the great culture
                                of his/her state and country. Also the student develops understanding for Regional
                                culture, beliefs and language.<br>
                                But after 8th standard when a student gets serious about his career and academics he/she
                                must be transferred to CBSE so that he can gain exposure to National and International
                                academics and studies. Also the student will be able to compete in many National
                                competitions and events.<br>
                                Also, in most state boards getting marks is tougher. So, being in CBSE will be somewhat
                                easier to score marks and thus good marks can make a good impression overall.<br>

                                Conclusion:<br>

                                This was just our suggestion we do recommend and expect that you must do own analysis
                                and research and also consider various factors before coming to any conclusion.<br>
