                                <b> Why is air pollution considered an issue? </b> <br>

                                Air is one of the important things to live on Earth and the pure air is more important
                                than only air for a healthy life. <br>

                                Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the
                                health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to
                                materials. <br>
                                The environment was balanced earlier but in the last few decades the Science and
                                Technology has grown too fast- even more than expected. Capitalists have used Nature for
                                their profit without considering the after effect of their products on the environment. <br>

                                <b>The main causes of air pollution are:</b> <br>


                               <i> 1). Pollution due to vehicles: </i><br>
                                When there are too many vehicles in our major cities like Delhi, Mumbai. Many dangerous
                                gases are released from these vehicles and they get mixed in our inhalable air. <br>
                                Due to high density of vehicles the concentration of pollutants is high and this causes
                                many health problems in the residents of that city. <br>

                                <i> 2).Stubble burning </i><br>
                                Before the Green Revolution harvesting was done manually, farmers would cut the crops
                                from the ground and use the stubble to feed their animals, but now the harvesting is by
                                machines, combines, etc. so they cut the crop from 2 feet above the land and leave the
                                stubble standing. <br>
                                After that the sowing time for the next crop remains very little due to the government
                                irrigation policies in Haryana . If the farmers cut it then time and energy both are
                                wasted because stubble has no monetary value in the market. So it is not affordable for
                                them to cut the stubble and use it, so instead they burn the standing stubble. This
                                burning causes too much pollution in the regions around Delhi and many places in UP
                                also. <br>

                                Effects of Air Pollution: <br>


                                Ozone layer depletion : <br>
                                The main cause of ozone layer depletion and the ozone hole at many places is due to many
                                manufactured chemicals , especially the halocarbons
                                refrigerants,solvents,propellants,and foam blowing agents (CFC’s , HCFS’s ,halons etc.). <br>

                                Ozone layer depletion causes increased UV radiation levels at the Earth's surface, which
                                is damaging to human health. Negative effects include increases in certain types of skin
                                cancers, eye cataracts and immune deficiency disorders.UV rays also affect plant growth,
                                reducing agricultural productivity. <br>



                                Acidic Rain <br>
                                Acid rain is caused by a chemical reaction that begins when compounds like sulfur
                                dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released into the air. These substances can rise very
                                high into the atmosphere, where they mix and react with water, oxygen, and other
                                chemicals to form more acidic pollutants.These pollutants come down dissolved in water
                                in the form of acidic rain. <br>


                                <i>  3). Other Effects:</i> <br>
                                Effects can be broken down into short-term effects and long-term effects. <br>
                                Short-term effects, which are temporary, include illnesses such as pneumonia or
                                bronchitis. They also include discomforts such as irritation to the nose, throat, eyes,
                                or skin. <br>
                                The long-term effects of air pollution can last for years or an entire lifetime. They
                                can even lead to a person's death. Air pollution’s long-term health effects include
                                heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution
                                can also cause long-term damage to people's nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other
                                organs. Some scientists suspect air pollutants cause birth defects. Nearly 2.5 million
                                people die worldwide each year from the effects of outdoor or indoor air pollution. <br>





                              <b> Solutions </b>  <br>
                                Planting trees is a good option, every year every young person should plant a tree and
                                care for it. From this in India a total of 80 crore trees can be planted every year by
                                only young people. <br>
                                Go for electric vehicles instead of other vehicles, and other environment friendly
                                machines, etc. <br>
                                Government should subsidize electric vehicles, biogas, LPG’s, CNG’s, etc. even more to
                                promote their use and to create awareness. <br>
                                Government should ban stubble burning completely.The Government needs to start biogas
                                plants at district level and should start purchasing the stubble from farmers. <br>
                                The Government needs to ban the usage of very old vehicles in the Metro Cities. <br>
                                Municipal Corporations should focus on building a good waste management system so that
                                dangerous medical and electronic waste can be disposed safely. <br>



                               <b> India’s Performance: </b><br>
                                In the Yale Environmental Performance Index by Yale University, India ranked at 174th
                                position out of 178 countries on air pollution. Only Pakistan, China, Nepal, and
                                Bangladesh have worse air quality than India as per the index. For indexing, air
                                quality, water, sanitation, and status of biodiversity have been taken into account. The
                                overall rank of India is 155th, whereas most of the other BRICS countries are ahead of
                                India on the overall rating. <br>

                              <b>  Some Facts: </b><br>
                                India is the seventh most environmentally unsafe country in the world. <br>
                                Pollution caused by burning fuel-wood and biomass is one of the main causes of the Asian
                                brown cloud. This cloud delays the monsoon in India. <br>
                                Many auto-rickshaws and taxis in India use adulterated fuel. This is done to lower down
                                the price but it is the environment and ultimately we who have to pay the price back.
                                Some of the adulterants are very harmful to the environment as these emit unsafe
                                pollutants which further deteriorate the quality of air. <br>
                                According to a report , every resident of Delhi consumes polluted air that is the same
                                as consuming 50 cigarettes a day. <br>

                                30% of children in Bangalore suffer from Asthma due to air pollution. The city is also
                                regarded as the asthma capital of India. <br>
