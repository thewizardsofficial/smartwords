                                The second wave is diminishing little by little so have we heard. Politicians will soon
                                give themselves credit and publicize their work. Advertisements to show that they fought
                                corona bravely. Sweets to distribute among naive people who will chow down on them. But
                                They have to prepare for the third wave today. So that mistakes of the second wave are
                                not repeated. <br><br>
                                At the same time, another massive wave is already here. However, we are ignorant about
                                it. This wave will bring us to the streets. Disappointed, lost and helpless. Not due to
                                the shortage of oxygen but for another reason...I'm talking about a financial crisis
                                that has been looming over the country for years. Due to corona, it has become almost
                                like a pandemic which has engulfed millions of Indians and our economy. Economically
                                speaking, 2017 and 2018 weren't that great either, thanks to Demonetisation and GST.The
                                situation was already getting out of control. Medically speaking, our economic system
                                was showing symptoms of a disease.<br><br>
                                Falling Financees, rising unemployment, rising country's debt. Meaning, O2 level of
                                economy was close to 90. First wave of corona put it to the ventilator. Lakhs of people
                                who were in the middle class are no longer in it. Whereas poverty doubled in size after
                                the first wave. New data shows that GDP has shrunk by 7.3% in FY21. It is the biggest
                                shock to our economy in a long time. In the years to come, it will be said that the
                                economy is growing with so and so percentage. But when one has fallen so low any growth
                                that follows will appear better than it really is. It’s called low base effect. That
                                even a small rise from bottom will seem great.<br><br>
                                Truth, when you compare GDP at constant prices, in absolute numbers. In 2018, our GDP
                                was 140 lakh crores. In 2019-2020, it was 145 lakh crores. In 2020-2021, GDP has fallen
                                to 135 lakh crores. All economic indicators show that we are behind by two years. In
                                fact, worse than it was two years ago. And these are not just numbers, okay? It is
                                ground reality. Not only cost of life, second wave also rendered 1 crore Indians
                                jobless.17% urban unemployment and 14% rural unemployment.97% household incomes have
                                declined amid pandemic. CMIE reports say so.2-3% people's net worth’s have sky-rocketed.
                                The situation is such that those unemployed won't find jobs very easily. Especially in
                                the formal sector; they may have to wait for a year.<br><br>
                                Similarly, bringing the economy back on track will also take time. Covid still remains;
                                things may change in the next few months. Because, the pandemic has hurt our economy the
                                most. In May, $8 billion was lost in GDP, weekly. Surprisingly, some other countries
                                have fared better. Today, an average Indian is poorer than 2019.On the other hand,
                                Bangladesh's average income has surpassed that of India's per capita GDP. They focused
                                on exports, social progress and fiscal prudence. In simple words, Bangladesh's exports
                                grew at 8.6% every year. Their women labour force has consistently grown. Men-women
                                participating equally. In India and Pakistan, women participation has decreased.
                                Bangladesh has maintained a public debt-to-GDP ratio between 30% and 40% so that private
                                sectors can borrow easily. India and Pakistan's debt-to-GDP ratio, on the other hand, is
                                close to 90%. This is unhealthy because debt slows down growth.<br><br>

                                Moving on, as the debt-to-GDP ratio is complicated. Let's talk in terms which are
                                simpler to understand. In Sri Ganganagar, petrol is costliest at 105 Rs a litre. It is
                                close to the India-Pakistan border so prices are high due to distance and transportation
                                costs. But, in Mumbai also, the price of petrol has crossed 100 Rs mark. Middle class
                                will silently buy petrol at high tax without asking why.<br><br>
                                But this does not help mathematically. Yes, the same maths that politicians dislike or
                                wholesale price ../index pages/ inflation has hit an all-time high of 10.5% in April. It's a
                                record-breaking stat. Mainly due to a rise in prices of petroleum products.
                                International optimism around vaccination is linked to high commodity prices. So,
                                inflation before vaccination.<br><br>
                                'Let's tolerate it.' But inflation has shrunk our savings as well as Bank Balance.
                                Because investing in FD has also not helped. Let me explain. Interest rates on FD are
                                5.5% these days while the average inflation is 7%. Thus, 1.4% loss annually. If you are
                                in the 30% tax bracket then the post tax FD rate is only 3.85% resulting in almost -3%
                                returns. That is why people are moving to stocks because it can boost their savings as
                                well as the economy. Investing in stocks used to be difficult but now...<br><br>

                                And, if you are smart, you will be able to earn much more returns than FD. Smart people
                                are learning skills and investing. But how long will it take before the economy is back
                                on track? Even today we are a land of opportunities. Although stuck in the web of false
                                promises, we can still undo it.<br><br>
                                Remember those false dreams? That dollar will fall, rupee will rise? In 2014, 1 USD = 59
                                INR.Today, 1 USD = 73 INR.This shows that the power of our currency has declined over
                                the years. The ongoing decade is make or break for us.The last decade we lost due to
                                UPA's policy paralysis and NDA's wrong policies.2010-2020 is called the lost decade of
                                India.<br><br>
                                Will the next 10 years be the healing decade for India? For that we must take advantage
                                of our demographic dividend. Only then can we progress. Because, from 2050 onwards,
                                India's population will get older.<br><br>
                                Now you will ask: What is the demographic dividend?<br><br>
                                It's like a blank cheque. Let's put a value and cash it.<br><br>
                                Quick measures should be taken to revive the economy. More focus on the economy and less
                                on retrospective taxes. Save Financees from tax terrorism; new Financees should be
                                encouraged. Only Adani and Ambani cannot make 5 trillion USD. Thousands others will be
                                needed. Our companies are known the world over. That's why the stock market is closing
                                on record highs. Similar companies will have to be set up. Quality companies must.
                                Savings have reduced due to the pandemic. Government will have to infuse money so that
                                consumption increases. Nowadays, everyone is sitting on savings. Nobody is spending.
                                Money will come from privatisation of shrinking, non-core PSUs. Not those PSUs which are
                                profiting.<br><br>


                                America and the UK, wherever there is universal vaccination, are opening its economy
                                faster. The Government must admit mistakes as there was no vaccine strategy. Now, speedy
                                vaccination is the need of the hour. Paid for those who can and free for those who
                                can’t. We will have to rediscover federalism. One man/one office cannot run a large
                                country like ours. States will have to have their power, money. We forget that India is
                                a union. Less ego, less speeches, more work. People who question are not traitors.
                                Listen to them. Journalists entitled to protection against sedition, said the Supreme
                                Court recently.<br><br>
                                And finally, adopt a progressive approach because boycott, ban, hate won't take us to 5
                                trillion USD..<br><br>
