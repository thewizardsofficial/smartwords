                            Rise in Cyber Attacks: An Alarming Thing <br>

                            

                            “Data is the new Oil” – a very appropriate sentence in today’s world. Today the whole world
                            is run by some or other form of data whether it is digital data, analog data, signals,
                            internet or anything. Many big companies invest heavily on data analytics so that they can
                            get, understand and use a customer’s data for improving their sales. But, now data is the
                            newest target of malicious people. They use many techniques to target and extract data of a
                            person from the system. Let’s have a look on how they do so and how can we protect
                            ourselves: <br>
                            What are Cyber Attacks ? <br>

                            A Cyber Attack is an unwanted intruding by hackers using a bunch of techniques from their
                            computers against a particular network of computers. <br>
                            A cyber attack can be sometimes very depressing i.e. how can anyone’s data be leaked, stolen
                            or hacked easily like this. <br>
                            Why are Cyber Attacks? <br>
                            Cyber attacks and cyber frauds generally happen for some specific reasons like: <br>
                            1). Manipulate the computer or person to get money or financial benefit. <br>
                            2). Get some kind of sensitive or crucial information. <br>
                            3). To just harass someone by doing harm to their network or PC. <br>
                            Usually the attacker has some or the other benefits of breaching or disrupting other's
                            networks through their PCs. <br>
                            Most cyber attacks occur at home networks or PCs of people because they do not have
                            sufficient knowledge about these attacks and hackers take full advantage of these things. <br>
                            Fact: First Cyber Attack was detected between the area of conflicts of India and Pakistan in
                            the early 1990s. <br>

                            Types of Cyber Attacks <br>
                            Daily many new cyber attacks are detected somewhere or the other in the world. So, if we
                            want to defend ourselves from them we need to firstly know about them. Cyber-Attacks are of
                            many types. Let’s explore them one by one: <br>

                            Malware : <br>

                            The term malware can be broken like malicious (derived from malice, worms) ware. From there
                            we can identify that it is related to viruses and worms intruding the computer. Malware can
                            harm your computer in the following ways :- <br>
                            Denied access to important file systems. <br>
                            Losing full control on our devices. <br>
                            Some forms of malware are designed to extort money from victims. Perhaps the most notable
                            form of malware is Ransomware – a program designed to encrypt the victim’s files and then
                            ask them to pay a ransom in order to get the decryption key. <br>

                            2). Phishing : <br>
                            Phishing in simple meaning means to send a bomb of fraudulent emails to users, disguised as
                            they are coming from a trusted source leading to building trust in the users and a good
                            chance to enable users to leak their information to that malicious email-sending body. <br>
                            Phishing is the most common form of cyber-attack, because it is easy to carry-out, and
                            surprisingly it is very effective also. <br>

                            3). SQL Injections :  <br>
                            The SQL injection is an advanced type of cyber attack where the hackers try to intrude the
                            system by injecting a malicious code into the server through SQL which enforces the server
                            to reveal the important information. SQL databases use SQL statements to query the data, and
                            these statements are typically executed via a HTML form on a webpage. If the database
                            permissions have not been set properly, the attacker may be able to exploit the HTML form to
                            execute queries that will create, read, modify or delete the data stored in the database. <br>


















                            We just introduced the 3 most common cyber attacks. If you want to know about other attacks
                            also then you can refer to this link: <br>

                            Effects and damages from Cyber-Attacks: <br>
                            1). Cyber Attacks causes financial losses in billions to the world. <br>



                            2). Sometimes cyber attacks are made on National organizations or governments. Thus
                            sometimes National security and some secret data of government may also be compromised or
                            leaked. <br>
                            3). When attacks are made on: <br>
                            a. Hospitals: This can disrupt the machines and oxygen supply and thus can prove to be
                            lethal for people’s lives and can cause deaths in large numbers. During the covid-19
                            pandemic number of attacks on hospitals have increased drastically. <br>
                            b. Control Systems: Most of the industries and manufacturing factories use systems that are
                            heavily dependent on computers. So, a hacker can attack these control systems and can
                            change, alter or even stop the whole machinery. Hackers hack these control systems and then
                            demand a large amount of money to pull back their attack. <br>
                            c. Energy Infrastructure: Many times hackers target companies or organizations that
                            transport or generate energy like electricity, natural gas or crude oil to people. <br>
                            Now-a-days most of the energy generation and transportation is done using computer systems
                            only so as energy is a basic necessity of humans, the energy companies or govt. <br>
                            organizations become the target of hackers for ransom. <br>
                            d. Financial Institutions: Money is constantly being exchanged in these financial
                            institutions which includes many banks, brokerage firms and stock exchange centers, so
                            hackers try to reroute these large amounts of money. If they do it on a large amount then
                            financial industries could collapse and civilians would have to suffer as they are the one
                            who lose the money. Also, these could civil unrest and loss of many jobs due to industry
                            collapse. <br>
                            e. Telecommunications: Many a times these cyber terrorists don’t do attacks for money,
                            sometimes they just want to harass people or the government. An easy way to do this is just
                            disrupt the communication systems and the internet. They use complex techniques to disrupt
                            the internet so that all information flow comes to halt in a region and this can sometimes
                            lead to huge indirect losses. <br>
                            How to protect ourselves from these attacks: <br>
                            We should have proper knowledge about these things. <br>
                            We should write such types of articles to gain awareness about cyber security. <br>
                            We should seek knowledge from experts. <br>
                            We should always keep a backup of data so at least the problem of data loss can be reduced. <br>
                            We should keep a streak of password i.e. multiple password encryption to protect ourselves
                            from these types of attacks up to some extent. <br>
                            We should check unknown mails many times and identify whether they are from a trusted source
                            or not. Checking can be done in a way that the sender is not asking for any money or data. <br>
                            And if there is a suspicious link without a‘s’ in https (secure). <br>
